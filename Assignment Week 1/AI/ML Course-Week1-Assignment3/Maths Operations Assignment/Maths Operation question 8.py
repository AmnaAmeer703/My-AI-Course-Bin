# Python Program to Check Armstrong Number 
#Armstrong Number in Python: Armstrong Number is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Armstrong numbers are 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407, etc. 
 #Formula to calculate Armstrong Number: wxyz = pow(w,n) + pow(x,n) + pow(y,n) + pow(z,n) 
 #Example 1: Let’s look at 153 as an example to understand why it’s an Armstrong number. 
 #153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 
#= 1 + 125 + 27 
#= 153 

#Example 2: Let’s look at 13 as an example to understand whether it’s an Armstrong number or not. 
 #13 = 1*1 + 3*3 
 #   = 1 + 9 
 #   = 10 
#Here, since 10 is not equal to 13, we can conclude that 13 is not an Armstrong number. 
#[Write a Python Program to check if a number is an Armstrong number. If the number is an 
#rmstrong then display “it is an Armstrong number” else display “it is not an Armstrong number”.
